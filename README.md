Requires JDK 1.7 or higher!

The Spark Kernel has one main goal: provide the foundation for interactive applications to connect and use [Apache Spark][1].

The kernel provides several key features for applications:

1. Define and run Spark Tasks

    - Executing Scala code dynamically in a similar fashion to the _Scala REPL_ and _Spark Shell_

2. Collect Results without a Datastore

    - Send execution results and streaming data back via the Spark Kernel to your applications

    - Use the [Comm API][2] - an abstraction of the IPython protocol - for more detailed data 
      communication and synchronization between your applications and the Spark Kernel

3. Host and Manage Applications Separately from Apache Spark

    - The _Spark Kernel_ serves as a proxy for requests to the Apache Spark cluster

The project intends to provide applications with the ability to send both packaged jars and code snippets. As it implements the latest IPython message protocol (5.0), the Spark Kernel can easily plug into the 3.x branch of IPython for quick, interactive data exploration. The Spark Kernel strives to be extensible, providing a [pluggable interface][3] for developers to add their own functionality.

For Cassandra you may need to override some of the spark cassandra connector settings such as

    spark.cassandra.connection.host 127.0.0.1

If you're starting the kernel from the command line, you can add spark settings to the command line as follows:

    --spark-configuration spark.cassandra.connection.host

use a --spark-configuration for each separate parameter

If you're starting it through iPython notebook, you will have created a kernel.json file.  Add this to the args

    "--spark-configuration",
    "spark.cassandra.connection.host=127.0.0.1"
